### What's the difference between nextjs-template and next-server?

Nextjs Template is used for publishing, Nextjs-Server is used to generate plugin views

### Why is nextjs-template in the monorepo and in nextjs-template repo?

The monorepo is the source of truth and where development happens. The template repo is where we export changes so users can pull them down when building with the nextjs template

## Summary

Community guidelines for conduct, discussion, and finding new ways of recognizing outstanding community members or contributors (eg. swag, roles, starboard, etc). 

## Lookup
- [[Dendron Discord|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.discord]]
- [[Discord Roles|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.discord.roles]]
- [[Discord Channels|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.discord.channels]]
- [GitHub Docs: Adding a code of conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)

## Initial Tasks
- review and update [[Dendron Discord page|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.discord]], and sync it with what is in the `#root` channel on Discord
  - we should probably also link to [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Discord Safety Center](https://discord.com/safety)

## Recurring Tasks


## Future Tasks
- we don't have a code of conduct other than a general statement of being nice and welcoming. We should have one that exists in our GitHub repos and also be linked to from the `#root` Discord channel (along with from our docs)
  - Some code of conducts for reference:
    - [TheGoodDocsProject Code of Conduct](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/code-of-conduct/)
      - [Moderators Guide](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/governance/blob/master/COMMUNITY_MODERATORS.md)
    - [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)
      - [Mozilla Free Tranining on Code of Conduct](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/cpg-training-contributors)
    - [Apache Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html)
    - [Twitter OSS Code of Conduct](https://github.com/twitter/.github/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)

## Open Questions and Ideas
- going through [Discord Moderator Academy](https://discord.com/moderation) may be worthwhile, such as [implementing verification gates](https://discord.com/moderation/1500000177981-301:-Implementing-Verification-Gates) to safeguard the community as it grows. I've read that communities have learned the hard way and needed to create their verification gates after incidents of things like server raiding have occurred.

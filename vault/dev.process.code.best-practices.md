## Summary

This page covers best practices when implementing code changes. [[dev.process.code]] focuses on code conventions (which are also a part of best practices), while this page covers higher level concepts.

## High Level

1. Reduce State - code written with minimal state are easier to test and reason about then code with state
1. Reduce coupling - code that is loosely coupled is better than the opposite
1. Reduce complexity - code that is simpler is better
1. Reduce code - code that is not duplicated 

### Reduce coupling

When introducing abstractions, beware of coupling. In general, we'd rather have two separate implementations of a thing than forcing two unrelated functions to use, for example, a common base class, to safe on lines of code. 

Unless you're relatively certain that something will be re-used, we default to implementing a thing two or three times. If at that point we notice that it does indeed share a lot in common, we will create a common abstraction for it.

## Avoiding Circular Dependencies

New code should not introduce any new circular dependencies, particularly in the [[pkg.plugin-core]] package.  We are actively working on getting to 0 circular dependencies.

### Ensure no new circular dependencies are being added

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that you are not adding new circular dependencies.  Circular dependencies in plugin-core may be added under the following conditions:
1. You have code changes in the [[pkg.plugin-core]] package.
1. You add new imports to an existing file.

If these conditions are met, please run through the following steps below:

### Checking for Circular Dependencies in Plugin-Core

1. If madge is not installed, first run `npm -g install madge`
1. Check how many circular dependencies exist in plugin-core at the last commit from master prior to your change. To check, run
    ```bash
        > cd ./packages/plugin-core
        > madge --circular --extensions ts .
    ```
    Make a note of how many circular dependencies exist.
1. Checkout the git hash of your last commit that's part of your change list. Rerun the madge command.
    1. If the number is less than or equal, put a note in your review description saying so.
    1. If the number is greater, then change your code to eliminate the circular dependencies introduced

*Action Required* - As part of the code review process, perform the following steps
1. first check how many circular dependencies exist at the last commit from master (prior to your change).
1. check the circular dependency again with your changes.
    1. If the number is less than or equal, put a note in your review description saying so.
    2. If the number is greater, then change your code to eliminate the circular dependencies introduced (see exceptions)
1. Include the before and after results in your PR description.

Exceptions to the rule:
- Emergency Fixes
- You're working on a change to actually try to unwind circular dependencies - sometimes, madge may under report how many circular dependencies actually exist. That is, it won't report circular dependencies in `bar` until dependencies in `foo` were fixed. Double check to make sure your code is not the one introducing the dependencies newly reported in `bar`; if not, it's ok to proceed.

_Note: Once we get down to 0 circular dependencies, we can add an automated CI/CD guard that absolves the need to run these steps manually._

## Deprecate old versions of APIs and functions

If we want to make changes to a commonly used function signature, then first assess if it's feasible to refactor existing usages to the new signature.  If the scope is too large or the risk of regression is too large, then we can create a versioned instance of the API.  When doing this, make sure to mark the previous version with the `@deprecated` tag so that people will know to use the newer API.

Furthermore, if you're touching a file that uses a deprecated API, please change the deprecated instances as part of your changelist. In VSCode, any deprecated function call will have a ~~strikethrough~~ the function name.

Some examples:

```typescript
  /**
   * Check if a path belongs to a workspace
   @deprecated - use {@link WorkspaceUtils.isPathInWorkspace}
   */
  isPathInWorkspace(fpath: string) {
    const vaults = ConfigUtils.getVaults(this.config);
    const wsRoot = this.wsRoot;
    return WorkspaceUtils.isPathInWorkspace({ fpath, vaults, wsRoot });
  }
```

## Going outside of the typescript compiler

We are moving to do strict typechecking on the entire codebase. Sometimes, especially during testing, we might need to do typecasts of the form `foo!.bar` or use `@ts-ignore`. 
In order to do this, we use the following convention `UNSAFE_{your-method-name}` for type casts. 
This groups all unsafe casting in a common place and will allow us to turn on strict type checking on the rest of the code base

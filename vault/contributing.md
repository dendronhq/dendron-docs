If you would like to contribute to the development of Dendron, checkout out the [Dendron repo](https://link.dendron.so/github) from GitHub.

You can then follow the [[Dendron Plugin Quickstart|dendron://dendron.docs/pkg.plugin-core.quickstart]] to get started with development.

A great place to start is with issues labelled with the [size.small](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/size.small) label on GitHub. These are small, self contained tasks that are well suited for first time contributors.

Leave a comment in the issue if you decide to work on it. Issues that are being worked on will be assigned to a person already.

The development process for dendron is described in [[here|dendron://dendron.docs/dev.process]].
Remember that you are always welcome to ask for help inside the [#dev Discord channel](https://link.dendron.so/discord).

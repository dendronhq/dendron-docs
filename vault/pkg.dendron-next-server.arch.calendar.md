## Arch

```ts
CalendarView {
  ...
  return !engineInitialized

  return Calendar
}
```

## Design Decision

- Had a long discussion with my coworker on how to think about this
  - We tried to figure out what the right responses are when interacting with the calendar and opening daily notes
  - We asked us what is it that is happening for the user when he switches the calendar mode. What is an analogy to capture it
  - We figured it's a zoom and used googlemaps as an example
  - Then we asked us what the behavior would be if it is "only" a zoom and suddenly it made all sense. We could derive the correct implementation from it
  - This made us realize that we are working with different languages/dimensions. The implementation, representation and the user mental model as the zoom analogy
  - If you don't realize this you will get confused and frustrated.
  - We realized also that we worked it out bottom-up and not top-down also observing that we mostly work bottom-up.
    - Generally we can travers these dimensions/languages from either direction but to materialize them a bottom-up approach seems to be a good default.
  - Complicated code is a good sign your mental model is wrong
    - complication is reduced by the right concept, mental model, metapher
  - sources to read about this
    - https://pointjupiter.com/ux-mental-model-representation-implementation-user-experience-development/
    - https://hbr.org/2005/04/how-strategists-really-think-tapping-the-power-of-analogy
  - Conclusions we made based on that:
    - active month note `2021.07` should not have an active highlight in montly calendar view
      - zooming in (month to day when month is active) should not change the active note
    - open a new calendar entry to the right and not replace it
      - allows the user to easily switch between already opened entries
    - show monthly mode when montly entry is active
      - adjusting the zoom to the appropriate level
    - meaning tabs lead calendar; calendar only leads when clicking on a field
      - user action determines behavior
      - mode switching is a kind of zooming
    - Inconsitencies
      - antd Calender does show current day but not current month
    - issues
      - calendar reload on every day change (stopped to happen now..)
      - when `Calendar`'s prop `value` is `null`, which has the purpose to have no active/assigned/highlighted day, causes an error when switching months from the header
        - This might be the reason why official `null` is not supported. But then how can I tell the antd's `Calendar` to not hightlight a day?
      - I came across a failure within `getMaybeDatePortion` where it was called with `journalName` being `undefined`.

## Summary

How we manage Dendron promoted community gardens 

## Lookup
- [The Open PKM Catalogue - PKM](https://pkm.dendron.so/)

## Initial Tasks
- update pkm catalogue to nextjs template
- refactor layout for pkm template
- propose ideas for other community gardens 

## Recurring Tasks
- when pkm related topics pop up in chat/reading series/the world, incorporate them into the pkm catalogue
- relay updates to community gardens with the wider dendron community

## Future Tasks
- recruit other stewards to help maintain and grow additional gardens

## Open Questions and Ideas
- can we visualize "health of a garden" (eg. number of active pages) and display that on the site
- brainstorm features to make public gardens more useful
- do different gardens relate or reference each other? 
- how does a garden remix and use content that already exists on github and elsewhere?

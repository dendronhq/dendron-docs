## Summary

How we get more users involved in the contribution process

## Lookup
- [[Contribute|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.contribute]]

## Initial Tasks
- add `good first task` labels to tasks
- establish criteria of what makes a `good first task`

## Recurring Tasks
- compile list of new issues that are good first tasks and broadcast to community

## Future Tasks
- spread awareness of tasks that aren't code related (eg. icons and assets)
- end to end tutorial of common types of changes (eg. adjust behavior of an existing command)
    - really like the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/) for their walkthroughts

## Open Questions and Ideas
- if a task is kept open for a long time but without any movement, do we leave it in the `good first task` pool or should it be pruned?
- how to spread awareness about tasks
- live coding with dendron team 
- what other resources can we provide folks to make it easier to contribute?

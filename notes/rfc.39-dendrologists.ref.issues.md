## Summary

How we collect [[Issues|dendron://dendron.docs/rfc.39-dendrologists#issues]] with the community

## Lookkup
- [[CROP|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.crop]]

## Initial Tasks
- give primary access to our backlog for CROPs (airtable view)
- give permissions to add crop to pool (all dendrologist should do this)
- review process for ranking crops (it's pretty manual right now)
    - open questions: what do we do with crops that are highly voted for but don't make it this round? does it move to the bottom of the Q or do we always take the top 3? if so, should there be a degradation based on time?

## Recurring Tasks
- send out crop every two weeks in the `#feedback` channel
    - after 1 week of voting, forward crop to the team

## Future Tasks
- come up with a public facing dashboard for upcoming issues
- group crops by scope (eg. publish, cli, refactoring, etc)

## Open Questions and Ideas
- what are other mechanisms besdies CROP to relay issues to the team?
- can we do CROPs according to themes? eg. refactoring month vs publishing month
- how to deal with larger items (eg. items that will take multiple weeks to complete)?
- any way to relate this focus area with [[contributors|dendron://dendron.docs/rfc.39-dendrologists#contributors]]?

What does `insideNoteRef` flag actually effect?

- [[../packages/unified/src/remark/backlinks.ts]]
    - don't render backlinks
- [[../packages/unified/src/remark/dendronPub.ts]]
```ts
transformer {
    // check that fname and vault is available
    // decide on what note it is
}

```
- [[../packages/unified/src/remark/dendronPub.ts]]
- skip hierarchies

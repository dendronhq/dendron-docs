For new features, consider using the Feature Showcase options to highlight the feature to users to encourage adoption.

There are currently two options for displaying messages:
1. Dendron Feature Toaster - shows a one-time toast to users with a message about a certain feature with optional buttons to launch any command.
1. 'Tip of the Day' - a panel in the Dendron Activity Bar View Container that shows a rotating 'tip of the day' message.


For an implementation example, see see https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/2832.

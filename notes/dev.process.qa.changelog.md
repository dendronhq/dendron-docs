### 2022-05-17 - upgrade jest 
- pr: https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/2918
- author: @kevin

- jest has been upgraded to v28
    - notable changes: 
        - it is now illegal for a test to both be `async` and use the `done` callback
        - `done` being called multiple times will result in an error
- all test dependencies  (aka jest and friends) with the exception of the following packages are now handled and executed in the root of the monorepo
    - nextjs-template
    - dendron-plugin-views
- to execute all non-plugin tests via the CLI 
    ```bash
    cd $MONOREPO_ROOT
    yarn ci:test:cli
    ```
- to watch a single non-plugin tests via vscode
    ```
    1. Open the `.spec.ts` file you want to test in VSCode
    2. Use command prompt and run `> Tasks: Run tasks`
    3. Run the following task `> test:watch root`
    ```
- to debug a single non-plugin test via vscode
    ```
    Use `Launch Task` and run `Debug One Test (root)` on a `spec` file that you want to test. This will run the test in `debug` mode which will enable breakpoints. 
    ```

        - Extension.test: test regular activation logic
        - Extension-PostInstall: test plugin install logic
        - Extension-PostUpgrade: test version upgrade logic
    - add `SetupWorkspace.test`
- updates to test utilties

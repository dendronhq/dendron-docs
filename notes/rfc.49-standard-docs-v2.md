## Goals

Provide a standard documentation standard for https://wiki.dendron.so

## Context

We currently don't have a standard for the dendron wiki that covers all types of docs. 
This project aims to introduce one as well as a plan for refactoring the docs to conform to this standard.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] make it umnabiguous where to add howtos/reference/discussions/tutorials on new features and capabilities
- [ ] make it umnabiguous where to find howtos/reference/discussions/tutorials on existing features and capabilities
- [ ] come up with a list of features for dendron/schemas that makes it easier to programatically manage the standards for wiki.dendron
- [ ] apply the new standard to at least 2 [[dendron.topic]] hierarchies
- [ ] create a process to iteratively convert dendron wiki to new standard and keept track of: what has been converted, what still needs to be converted

## Proposal
- Overall structure of docs: [[Standard Documentation|dendron://dendron.handbook/leaflet.journal.2022.05.10.standard-documentation]] 
- How to structure different kinds of pages: [[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.contribute.documentation.tutorial]]

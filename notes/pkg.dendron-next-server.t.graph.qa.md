## Testing

When fixing/adding a feature, test the following:

- Test the feature/change added
- Test change in both note and schema graphs
- Test filters, navigating to notes, etc. in addition to testing the change
- Test change in at least one other workspace in addition to `test-workspace`; ideally, this is a large workspace at scale like `org-workspace`

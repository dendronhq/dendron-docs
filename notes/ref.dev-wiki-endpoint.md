The dev version of `wiki.dendron.so` is available at https://dev.d272yu3etotcws.amplifyapp.com/

It's protected by basic auth - `dendron/dendron` are the credentials. The protection is not for security but to keep google bot from crawling it until we get a proper robots.txt file up

`wiki.dendron.so` has everything from the `dev` branch. It also has features from `nextjs-template` that are currently in development

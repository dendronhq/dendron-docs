## Summary

This packages hold assets for Dendron Views. During the [[build step|dendron://dendron.docs/pkg.plugin-core.quickstart#^OI7k28ZBdX9W]], assets from this package are concatenated and copied into [[pkg.nextjs-template]] and [[pkg.dendron-plugin-views]] (TODO: need to refactor logic from `dendron-plugin-views`, currently assets are being built separately there).

- NOTE: we are currently moving away from `dendron-next-server` and transferring all css and assets from it to `common-assets`

  - assets/
    - css/
      - prism/
        - dark.css

## LifeCycle

1. User runs `yarn setup` in Dendron monorepo
1. The last step after all packages are build, is running
   ```sh
   dendron dev sync_assets --fast
   ```
   - this runs the following
   ```ts
   // loc: [[../packages/dendron-cli/src/commands/devCLICommand.ts#L388]]
   // Takes assets from different monorepo packages and copies them over to the plugin
   syncAssets {
       // sync assets to plugin
       syncStaticAssets
       syncStaticAssetsToNextjsTemplate
   }
   ```

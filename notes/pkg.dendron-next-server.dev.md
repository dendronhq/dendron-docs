## Development

### Pre-req
- [[pkg.plugin-core.quickstart]]
- [[Symlink the CLI|pkg.dendron-cli.dev.cook.symlink-cli]] `dendron-cli`

### Steps

You can test the Dendron Next App by launching a workspace using the CLI and then connecting to it. The instructions below cover using `dendron/test-workspace`.

1. Add to `dev` config of `$DENDRON_REPO_ROOT/test-workspace/dendron.yml` 
   ```yml
   dev:
     engineServerPort: 3005
     nextServerUrl: http://localhost:3000
   ```
1. Initialize test-workspace
  ```sh
  cd $DENDRON_REPO_ROOT/test-workspace && ./scripts/dev.sh
  ```
1. In a separate terminal, start the Next Server
  ```sh
  cd $DENDRON_REPO_ROOT/packages/dendron-next-server && yarn dev
  ```
1. (optional) To connect to the workspace using chrome, enter the following in your localhost (replace WORKSPACE and PORT with your own values) ^MgEdJdyD
   ```sh
   # for example, if you launched the engine at /user/adam/workspace, WORKSPACE should equal /user/adam/workspace
   http://localhost:3000/vscode/sample?ws=$WORKSPACE&port=$PORT&browser=1
   ```
1. To test the UI with the plugin, see instructions to [[run the extension|dev.debug]]. When running, make sure to use `test-workspace` to access the UI

Next Steps:
- read the [[architecture|pkg.dendron-next-server.arch]] documents to understand how the next server fits in with other Dendron plugins and how to build on top of it

### PR Checklist
- see [[Review|dev.process.commit]]
- [ ] make sure your UI is compatible with light/dark theme 


## Issues

### Conflicting Views
- if you have conflicting views warning when debugging, its most likely because you've installed Dendron in the same version of VSCode that you are developing on. We highly recommend you keep two instances of VSCode and not install Dendron on the version you use for development

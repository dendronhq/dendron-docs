## General

### Conflicting Schemas

By default, all schemas of a given seed are local to the given seed. This means they won't apply outside of the seed vault

### Hosting Private Registries
- [[Next Phase ‚è©|dendron._ref.status#next-phase-]]

You will be able to specify on a per package level the registry you want to use. 

## Workflow

### Upgrading Seeds

For the current phase, seeds are un-versioned. When you add a seed, you get the vault and the git repository. Getting the latest changes is equivalent to doing a `git pull` in the repository. 

### Make Contributions to seeds

Because a seed is just a git repo, if it is hosted on github/gitlab, you can use the standard pull request procedure.

## Publishing

### Why be part of the seed bank?

Besides for doing the noble work of spreading knowledge, everyone benefits from a growing seed bank. 

As a publisher:
- your documentation will be made accessible to all Dendronlogist
- you will get pull requests from users that are actively engaged with your subject matter
- for all open source projects, you will receive free hosting with analytics and user feedback

As a consumer:
- you have online and offline access access to notes that you need
- you can [[reference|dendron.topic.note-reference#block-reference]] third material within your own docs
